                <img src="푸앙_윙크.png" alt="Pooh-ang winking" class="mascot-wink">
                <p>
                    This major has been newly designed for international students in response to the global spread of K-culture
                    and the growing demand for specialists in Korean language education. It aims to cultivate global experts in
                    Korean language education who can lead the AI era, through a carefully structured curriculum and strategically
                    designed learning experiences.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>1.2. Official Program Description & Educational Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The Major in Korean Language Education & Korean Culture aims to nurture students who possess a balanced combination
                of theoretical knowledge in teaching Korean as a foreign language and a broad understanding of both traditional and
                contemporary Korean culture. In the first year, students build foundational skills through academic Korean speaking,
                reading, writing, and presentation courses, while also learning to use generative AI as a study tool. In the second
                year, they systematically build academic foundations by taking courses such as Introduction to Korean Linguistics,
                Korean Orthography and Norms, Literature, Contrastive Linguistics, and Korean Grammar. In the third year, they deepen
                their expertise in language education through courses on second language acquisition, pronunciation teaching, grammar
                teaching, comprehension and production, assessment, and textbook development. Finally, in the fourth year, students
                enhance their practical skills through teaching practicum and courses on contemporary popular culture and narrative
                analysis, completing their portfolio for future careers.
            </p>

            <h3>Educational Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To train educational professionals who, based on Korean linguistics, Korean language education, and Korean studies, are capable of operating Korean language classes and designing curricula, assessments, and teaching materials.</li>
                <li>To foster the ability to critically understand Korean culture from tradition to contemporary popular culture, and to develop skills in content analysis and storytelling.</li>
                <li>To establish the capacity to appropriately use digital tools, including generative AI, as supportive means for more efficient teaching–learning practices and for improving academic-purpose communication skills.</li>
                <li>To strengthen intercultural communication skills and practical field competence in multilingual and multicultural environments, thereby supporting students’ entry into educational institutions and cultural content sectors in and outside Korea.</li>
